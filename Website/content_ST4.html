                <h2>Introduction to SDG 4: Quality Education</h2>
                <p>Sustainable Development Goal 4 aims to "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all" by 2030. Education is a fundamental human right and is essential for the achievement of sustainable development. It empowers people to break from the cycle of poverty, fosters tolerance, and contributes to building more peaceful societies.</p>

                <p>Quality education is the foundation upon which we can build a more prosperous, peaceful, and sustainable world. It equips individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to lead fulfilled lives, make informed decisions, and contribute positively to society. SDG 4 acknowledges the transformative power of education and sets ambitious targets to improve access to education at all levels and for all people regardless of gender, geographical location, or socioeconomic status.</p>

                <h2>Current State of Education Globally</h2>
                <p>Despite significant progress in expanding access to education over the past decades, major challenges persist. Millions of children and youth remain out of school, and many more are in school but not learning the fundamental skills they need for life and work.</p>

                        <h3>Primary Education</h3>
                        <p>While global primary school enrollment rates have increased significantly, approximately 58 million children of primary school age were still out of school as of 2023. Regional disparities remain pronounced, with Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia facing the greatest challenges.</p>

                        <p>Secondary school enrollment rates lag behind primary rates, with only about 66% of young people enrolled worldwide. Gender disparities become more pronounced at this level in many regions, with girls often at a disadvantage.</p>

                <h2>Key Targets of SDG 4</h2>
                <p>SDG 4 encompasses 10 targets covering different aspects of education, from early childhood to adult learning. These targets provide a comprehensive framework for addressing the multiple dimensions of the education challenge:</p>

                <h3>Target 4.7: Education for Sustainable Development</h3>

                <h2>Challenges in Achieving Quality Education</h2>
                <p>Despite widespread recognition of the importance of education, numerous challenges impede progress toward SDG 4 targets:</p>
                
                <div class="challenge-box">
                    <h3>Funding Gaps</h3>
                    <p>Education systems in many countries remain severely underfunded. UNESCO estimates an annual funding gap of $148 billion to achieve quality universal education from pre-primary to secondary levels in low and lower-middle-income countries.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge-box">
                    <h3>Teacher Shortages</h3>
                    <p>There is a global shortage of qualified teachers. To achieve universal primary and secondary education by 2030, the world needs to recruit 69 million new teachers.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge-box">
                    <h3>Infrastructure Deficits</h3>
                    <p>Many schools lack basic infrastructure such as electricity, clean water, sanitation facilities, and internet connectivity, which are essential for effective learning environments.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="challenge-box">
                    <h3>Conflict and Displacement</h3>
                    <p>Armed conflicts and resulting displacement disrupt education for millions of children. Refugee children are five times more likely to be out of school than non-refugee children.</p>

                    <h3>Digital Divide</h3>
                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the stark digital divide that exists globally. In many developing countries, fewer than 20% of households have internet access, making online learning inaccessible for millions of students.</p>
